## Overview of Credit Card Default Payment
**Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.**

**A machine learning credit card default project is a data science project that aims to predict credit card default risk using machine learning techniques. Credit card default occurs when a credit cardholder fails to make the required minimum payment on their credit card balance for a specified period, usually 30 days or more.**

**The objective of the project is to build a predictive model that can assess the probability of a credit card user defaulting on their payments. This model can be valuable to banks, financial institutions, and credit card companies as it helps them identify customers who are more likely to default and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks.**
